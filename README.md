Turns spritesheet pngs into .aseprite files with all the frames split.


HOW TO USE:
Open up script.lua and edit:

paddingx
paddingy
frameWidth
frameHeight
To what your spritesheet is using.

Open up import_ss.bat:

ASEPRITE: Update the path to where your Aseprite.exe is located.

Aseprite required.

This expects all the spritesheets you want turned into .ase files to be in the same
directory.

Keep the .bat and the import script in the same directory.

I am willing to update if you open an issue request.
